## Summary
Dataset contains code and data used in analysis presented in manuscript.
Data was downloaded from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) data portal(https://data.neonscience.org/) and includes sites where airborne hyperspectral data was collected in conjunction with foliar chemistry sampling from 2016-2019.
Data was analyzed with code included in the "code" folder (contents listed below).

---------------------------------------------
## Files and Folders


#### code: code used in the analysis presented in the manuscript. 
- download_data.R: R code to download foliar chemistry data from the NEON data portal
- plantclip_locations.R: R code to get locations for herbaceous and woody plant clip samples
- plantclip_shp.R: R code to 1.	Convert plant clip (x,y) locations to spatial points object; 2.	Define projections of plant clips based on projections of NDNI raster for each site; 3.	Extract NDNI values at location of plant clips (buffer = X); 4. combine all herbaceous (where cover > 85%) and woody samples into a single data frame and write csv
- 3mbuff.R: R code to create 3m2 rectangle buffer around all plant clip locations. Export as polygon feature class .shp file.
- brdf_topoR2py.py: python code to perform topographic and BRDF corrections on the hyperspectral reflectance data. Will need to define ross and li kernel types for BRDF correction.
- hyperspec_info.py: python code to add metadata (e.g. spatial reference info) to the topo and BRDF corrected imagery
- extract_hyperspec.py: python code to extract the corrected hyperspectral reflectance values for each of the pixels IDed in '3mbuff.R'
- ref_agg.R: R code to aggregate the reflectance values at sampleID level to get a single averaged reflectance for each sample.
- site_meta.R code to get GLI, LAI, and sample proximity meta-data for each site/sample
- Map_KG-Global.R: R code to get Koppen-Geiger climate classifications for all sample locations.
- Fig1.R: R code used to create Fig1-- plots of reflectance data by biome, run ANOVA and create boxplot of foliar N by biome
- Table2.R: R code used to create Table2-- comparing foliar N values to previously published foliar N indices. 
- FNIcalc_Fig3.R: R code to calculate Foliar nitrogen indices (FNI) for all 2-band combinations according to NDVI, RVI, and SAVI- style calculations; Add these calculated FNI values to a matrix and remove all 0 values (when band 1 and band 2 are the same band); Create a matrix of regression coefficients for all 2 band FNIs; Then, create a heat map of these results.
- PLSRloop.R: R code to perform 100 iterations of PLSR analysis saving model outputs from each run.
- Fig4.R: R code to create the PLSR VIP graphs presented in Fig. 4
- Fig5.R: R code to create a heatmap of the PLSR VIP values from FNI presented in Fig. 5
- applyPLSR.R apply PLSR model coefficients to hyperspectral readings for all locations soil was sampled
- PLSR_Testsites.R evalaute model performance at testing sites.
